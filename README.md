Couchbase Spark Samples
=======================

This repository contains small snippets that showcase the usage of
the [Couchbase Spark Connector](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-spark-connector) 
with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). 

Please see the [Documentation](http://docs.couchbase.com) for quickstart and
full documentation. Also make sure to have at least the `travel-sample` and the
`default` bucket loaded. Some examples also need more setup like the twitter stream,
JDBC and Hadoop examples.

All examples can be run from the IDE by calling the `main` methods and you
can also run them from the command line, for example : `sbt "run-main DatasetExample"`
